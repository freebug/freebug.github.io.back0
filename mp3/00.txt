change shell to linux sh
WAP>shellBusyBox v1.18.4 (2013-02-01 22:12:01 CST) built-in shell (ash)
Enter ‘help’ for a list of built-in commands.profile close core dump, flag=
WAP(Dopra Linux) # echo $SHELL
/bin/sh
run below commands
WAP(Dopra Linux) # cd /mnt/jffs2/
WAP(Dopra Linux) # cp hw_ctree.xml /tmp
WAP(Dopra Linux) # ls -lrt
-rw-rw-rw- 1 root root 18504 Jan 23 01:58 hw_ctree.xml
now hw_ctree.xml is an encrypted file, so u can not view it by a normal text file editor like vi. So
WAP(Dopra Linux) # aescrypt2 1 hw_ctree.xml hw_ctree_tmp.xmlWAP(Dopra Linux) # ls -lrt
-rw-rw-rw- 1 root root 18433 Jan 23 01:59 hw_ctree.xml
hw_ctree_tmp.xml is not generated as expected, but original hw_ctree.xml is override. Its size is changed from 18504 to 18433.  It is now a gzip file. So
WAP(Dopra Linux) # gzip -d hw_ctree.xml.gz
WAP(Dopra Linux) # ls -lrt hw_ctree.xml
-rw-rw-rw- 1 root root 133006 Jan 23 01:52 hw_ctree.xml
Its size is changed to 133006, and is now a normal xml file.
vi it, search useradmin, change UserLevel to 0, make sure it has identical keys and values as telecomadmin.
gzip /tmp/hw_ctree.xml, run “ aescrypt2 0″ to encrypt it, move it to /mnt/jffs2/hw_ctree.xml, and reboot
The above steps make useradmin has same privilege as telecomadmin.
